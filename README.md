## Application Description
Tulay is a two-platform app that aims to intiate cultural awareness which can be deepened through cultural immersion, thus forming cultural intelligence. The end goal of the app is to attain a high degree of cultural integrity in the country. The first platform of Tulay is through a Messenger bot with the aim of providing cultural information about the Philippines. This platform is chosen to cater to people who want to be more culturally aware but do not always have access to wi-fi or mobile data. The second platform is geared with a deeper, more immersive cultural experience aimed at people who want to travel but are on a tight budget. The mobile application is intended to connect explorers who want to learn more about other cultures with local experts who are equipped with such cultural knowledge. Through the expertise of locals, an explorer may be able to gain a better understanding and appreciation of another's culture.
